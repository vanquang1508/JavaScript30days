    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    const team2 = players.slice();
    console.log(team2);
    // one way
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    	const captain = person;
    	captain.number = 90;
    	console.log(captain);

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    	const values2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number:99 , age: 19});
    	console.log(values2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    	// const values3 = [...person];

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
